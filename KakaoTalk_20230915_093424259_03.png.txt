big footprint on the history of architecture. Gaudi was}
‘reatly inspired by nature and tried to bring the beauty
of nature to his architecture. The most famous}
example is the Sagrada Familia, the famous church 01
Barcelona, The columns of the: church resemble 0005
in the forest. Also, he used glass and tiles to bring!
| sunlight inside the church. He paid attention to every
| lide detail in his architecture. If you look at his works
of architecture, you will be amazed at all the details

attracts many ~               |
